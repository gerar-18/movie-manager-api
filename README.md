# Movie Manager Api

## Environment Variables

A `.env.example` file is provided as a template for your environment variables. Copy this file to `.env` and set the necessary values.

## Running the Project Locally

### Using Docker

The project is dockerized and can be started using `docker-compose`, which will also set up the PostgreSQL database instance.

To start the project with Docker, run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Once the container is up and running, open a new terminal and run the migrations manually:

 ```bash
docker exec -it <container_name> npm run migration:run
```

### Without Docker

You can also run the project locally without Docker. To do this, you'll need a running PostgreSQL instance and the necessary environment variables.

## First, install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Then, run database migrations:
```bash
npm run migration:run
```

## Then, run the project:
```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Authentication in app

The project uses JWT-based authentication with role-based access control. Users must log in to receive a token, which must be included in subsequent requests to access protected routes. Guards and custom decorators are used to enforce authentication and role permissions (ADMIN, REGULAR_USER).
